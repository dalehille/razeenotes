title: Cluster Inventory Management
---

With [RazeeDash](https://github.com/razee-io/razeedash) and [Watch-keeper](https://github.com/razee-io/WatchKeeper), you can add your clusters to the Razee inventory list and start monitoring the deployment status of your Kubernetes resources by using intelligent filter and alerting capabilities. 

See the [[quick start]] guide for getting started with RazeeDash

If you already have RazeeDash installed then you can [[register new clusters]] to start tracking their resources and to [[automate the rollout of your resources]]
