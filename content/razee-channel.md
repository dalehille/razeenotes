title: Razee Channel
aliases: ["channels", "channel"]
---

A channel lets you upload new versions of a Kubernetes resource directly to Razee by using the Razee API. 
The channel keeps track of the different versions, but the versions are not yet applied to your clusters. To
apply the versions, you must create [[subscriptions]] and specify the version and [[cluster group]] that you want the version applied to.


**Is there a limitation what Kubernetes resources I can upload to Razee?**
You can upload any Kubernetes resource that you want to apply in your cluster to your [[channel]].
